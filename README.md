# gpxFileTool
gpxFileTool is a simple tool for manipulating GPX files. While it is generic enough to work with any type of activity, it was developed mainly to process GPX files from *cycling* activities recorded by such devices as a Garmin Edge or Wahoo Elemnt bike computer, or by mobile apps such as Strava or RideWithGps.
 
The GPS elevation data in these GPX files is usually subject to significant errors, which result in incorrect values for the total elevation gain/loss of the ride, and in incorrect values for the grade (incline) level during a climb/descent segment of the ride.  Having an incorrect value for the total elevation gain/loss simply skews one's own personal stats.  But the incorrect grade level is a problem when such GPX file is used to control a cycling "smart trainer".  The bbogus elevation values can result in spikes in the grade level that make the feeling of the *virtual ride* unrealistic, and in extreme cases it can suddenly **lock up** the smart trainer. Imagine you are pedaling your bike on the trainer at a steady pace while climbing a segment with a moderate 4% grade, when all of a sudden you get a spike that sends the grade level to 14% ... Yikes!
